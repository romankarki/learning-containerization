Bind Mounts:
    - whenever we changes in the code, it will be reflected in the container 
    - otherwise image and container are stale and won't reflect these changes 
    - solves the issue of stale image and container during development
    - volumes are similar to bind mounts but docker is not responsible for managing bind mounts as they do for volumes 
    -  docker run -p 3000:80 -d --rm --name feedback-name -v "C:\Users\ASUS\Desktop\learning-containerization\docker-volumes\data-volumes-01-starting-setup:/app" -v /app/node_modules  feedback
    - this solves the issue of dev mode and for node js server needs restarting so use nodemon 
so there is use for both named and anonymous volumes
